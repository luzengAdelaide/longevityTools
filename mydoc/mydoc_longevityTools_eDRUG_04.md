## Download data from Connectivity Map project site
The drug-related expression data are downloaded from the CMAP web site
[here](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap).  The `getCmap` function downloads
the CMAP rank matrix along with the compound annotations, and `getCmapCEL`
downloads the corresponding 7,056 CEL files. The functions will write the
downloaded files to the `data` and `data/CEL` directories within the present 
working directory of the user's R session. Since some of the raw data sets 
are large, the functions will only rerun the download if the argument `rerun` 
is assigned `TRUE`. If the raw data are not needed then users can skip this 
time consuming download step and work with the preprocessed data 
obtained in the next section.


{% highlight r %}
getCmap(rerun=FALSE) # Downloads cmap rank matrix and compound annotation files
getCmapCEL(rerun=FALSE) # Download cmap CEL files. Note, this will take some time
{% endhighlight %}


## Overview of CMAP data

The experimental design of the CMAP project is defined in the file
`cmap_instances_02.xls`.  Note, this file required some cleaning in LibreOffice
(Excel would work for this too). After this it was saved as tab delimited txt
file named
[cmap_instances_02.txt](http://biocluster.ucr.edu/~tgirke/projects/longevity/cmap/data/cmap_instances_02.txt).
The following count statisitics are extracted from this file.

The panel of cell lines used by CMAP includes 
[MCF7](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/help_topics_linkified.jsp#mcf7), 
[ssMCF7](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/help_topics_linkified.jsp#mcf7), 
[HL60](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/help_topics_linkified.jsp#hl60), 
[PC3](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/help_topics_linkified.jsp#pc3) and 
[SKMEL5](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/help_topics_linkified.jsp#skmel5). 
Each cell type was subjected to the following number of total treatments and number
of distinct drugs, respectively. The total number of drugs used by CMAP is 1,309.


{% highlight r %}
library(ggplot2); library(reshape2) 
cmap <- read.delim("./data/cmap_instances_02.txt", check.names=FALSE) 
df <- data.frame(table(cmap[, "cell2"]), as.numeric(table(cmap[!duplicated(paste0(cmap$cmap_name, cmap$cell2)),"cell2"])))
colnames(df) <- c("Cell_type", "Treatments", "Drugs")
df <- melt(df, id.vars=c("Cell_type"), variable.name = "Samples", value.name="Counts")
ggplot(df, aes(Cell_type, Counts, fill=Samples)) + 
       geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity") + 
       ggtitle("Number of treatments by cell types")
{% endhighlight %}

The number Affymetrix chip used in the experiments is plotted here for each of
the three chip types used by CMAP:


{% highlight r %}
df <- data.frame(table(cmap$array3)); colnames(df) <- c("Chip_type", "Counts") 
ggplot(df, aes(Chip_type, Counts)) + 
       geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity", fill="cornflowerblue") + 
       ggtitle("Number of chip types")
{% endhighlight %}
